Effects of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an Excite@Home Named Competitor under Section           16.a.v., the parties will communicate with Program Members as follows (Page 12)

Upon termination of this Agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an Excite@Home Named Competitor under Section           16.a.v., the parties will communicate with Program Members as follows: 

          i)   Excite@Home will email Program Members on e-centives' behalf up                to a maximum of two times. Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will

               continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out.  The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon. 

          ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out.                Excite@Home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage Program Members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives. 

          iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@Home shall not                discourage Program Members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives, but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services.
